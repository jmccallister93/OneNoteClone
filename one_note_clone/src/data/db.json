      "detail": "Goblin Ambush\nRead the following boxed text to start the encounter:\n\nYou’ve been on the Triboar Trail for about half a day. As you come around a bend, you spot two dead horses sprawled about fifty feet ahead of you, blocking the path. Each has several black-feathered arrows sticking out of it. The woods press close to the trail here, with a steep embankment and dense thickets on either side.\n\nIf you are using the “Meet Me in Phandalin” adventure hook, then any character who approaches to make a closer investigation can identify the horses as belonging to Gundren Rockseeker and Sildar Hallwinter. They’ve been dead about a day, and it’s clear that arrows killed the horses. When the characters inspect the scene closer, read the following:\n\nThe saddlebags have been looted. Nearby lies an empty leather map case.\n\nFour goblins are hiding in the woods, two on each side of the road. They wait until someone approaches the bodies and then attack.\n\nThis will likely be the first of many combat encounters in the adventure. Here are the steps you should follow to run it effectively:\n\nReview the goblin stat block in appendix B. Since the goblins are hiding, you’ll need to know their Stealth skill modifier: +6.\nCheck to see who, if anyone, is surprised. The party can’t surprise the goblins, but the goblins might surprise some or all of the characters. Make a Dexterity (Stealth) check for the goblins: roll one d20 for all of them, add their Stealth skill modifier (+6) to the roll, and compare the total to the characters’ passive Wisdom (Perception) scores. A character whose score is lower than the goblins’ check total is surprised and therefore can’t do anything on his or her first turn in the combat (see “Surprise” in the Basic Rules).\nUse the initiative rules in the Basic Rules to determine who acts first, second, third, and so on. Keep track of everyone’s initiative count on a piece of paper.\nWhen the time comes for the goblins to act, two of them rush forward and make melee attacks while two goblins stand 30 feet away from the party and make ranged attacks. The goblins’ stat block contains the information you need to resolve these attacks. For more information on what the goblins can do on their turn, see chapter 9, “Combat,” in the Basic Rules.\nWhen three goblins are defeated, the last goblin attempts to flee, heading for the goblin trail.\n",
